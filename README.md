# CS301 Project Proposal
The Kaggle competition for this problem can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

## The Problem
The problem that we will be investigating is predicting the sales price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa based on their features. 

This problem is interesting because it highlights how a house's features relate to the price that people are willing to purchase it for.

## Reading Material
The reading material that we will use to understand the context and background of this problem is 

## The Data
The data that we will be using is the Ames Housing dataset. This dataset consists of 80 features of houses in Ames, Iowa sold between 2006 and 2010. Examples of these features include how many stories the house has, the shape of the property, etc.

## The Method
Our currently proposed method of solving this problem is by using the technique of gradient boosting. Existing implementations of a solution to this problem use linear regression, which we are hoping to improve by introducing the use of gradient boosting.

## Evaluating the Result

### Qualitative
We will evaluate the results of our model qualitatively with use of plots to see how well our hypothesis fits the data.
